# Assighment-3
In this task you must use everything you`ve covered till this day. It is time to "show off"!

Using the same approach as in the Lecture JDBC ExampleURL, you are asked to create an application for medicines.

A user should have UI (user interface) to work with your application.

User must be able to:

Search for any medicine by name (use '%name%' in sql)
Get medicine by medicine_id
Add medicine to DB
Remove medicine by id (Hint: The user may be looking for any medicine that has expired)
And any other operation which from your personal view seems convenient
Use layering: entities, data, repositories, controllers, and application layer itself (e.g., Main.java, MyApplication.java).
Medicine has:

id
name
price
expiration date (LocalDate)
manufacturer
and any other fields
